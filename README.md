# 9-node-EF
 My 9th project for DU bootcamp.

# Description
In this module, we were asked to build a "README generator" with custom inputs for a user to fill out and then a readme with those inputs as well as a table of contents, and titles for each section of the README. I was successful in doing so, although I cam across some challenges, but in the end it all worked out nicely. I have created a video on how this works and walked through it step by step. Thankyou for this oppurtunity to showcase my skills and challenge myself a little.
